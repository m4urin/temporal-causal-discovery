# Causal Discovery in Time Series Data with Machine Learning

This repository contains code that is part of my thesis for my master's degree in Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Antwerp University.
The objective of the thesis is to develop a method for robust causal discovery in time series data using machine learning.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

The complete thesis is available for access and can be downloaded in PDF format [here](https://github.com/m4urin/temporal-causal-discovery/blob/main/thesis.pdf). This document presents a detailed overview of the research, methodology, and results obtained in this study.
